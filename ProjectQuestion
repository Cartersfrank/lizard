## Project Question and Data Set

Question: Do NBA officials change their behavior in order to extend best of 7 playoff series?

Using data scraped from NBA.com and Pro-Basketball-Reference.com, I'd like to use game, team and player statistics 
from the modern era NBA (going back to at least 2003, when all rounds of the NBA playoffs were extended to 7 games) 
to create a model that is capable of predicting the number of fouls per minute of playtime that a team will receive 
(per minute to account for overtime). If I can create a model that is sufficiently capable of doing so, then I am 
specifically interested in the significance and coefficient of a dummy input that will indicate if a given team has 
lost 3 games of a 7 game series prior to game 6 - i.e. if they lose, the series will be over, but if they win they 
will play an additional game.

Dataset:

Each record will be the outcome of a game for a single team (each game will appear twice, once for each team)

Output: # of Fouls / Minute of Playtime

Possible Inputes:
Dummy for Home vs. Away
Average # Fouls Across Last x Games
Average Time per Posession Across Last x Games
Size (Physical Attributes) Discrepancy for Starting Lineup vs. Opponent's
Dummy for Rivalry Match
